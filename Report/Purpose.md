# Purpose

This project demonstrates knowledge and skills expected of a senior-level Computer Engineering student by using a Field Programmable Gate Array to implement a video game. The project uses an FPGA to display video, output sound and take input from a game controller while also handling the game logic.

Many components of this project required significant research and testing to implement. Fortunately, each component was well documented and with proper research, I was able to successfully bring them all together into the final working device.

As a Computer Engineering student, gaining further knowledge and skills relating to FPGAs has been valuable as some of my potential career paths involve hardware description languages. This project provided new challenges to overcome as I researched and implemented its various components. This has increased my competence with hardware description languages and demonstrated an ability to learn new skills through research.
