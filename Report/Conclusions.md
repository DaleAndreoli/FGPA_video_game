# Conclusions

This project fills the purpose for which it was designed. The game is fun to play and works as designed. This project could easily be modified to make other games. Many of the modules would require little to no changes to be used in a different game. One could just design new game objects and game events while keeping the modules that run the hardware.

A nice improvement for this project would be an upgrade to the sound device. There are soundboard that can store audio files that can be triggered by a signal to one of its pins. That would be a simple and fun way to add multiple cool sounds to the game. This would also require a better speaker than my little buzzer. 

Another potential improvement to the project would be to design a module that could handle the bricks, similar to the other game objects. For now they are handled by loops in the Renderer and Collisions modules. This would give the project more consistency in its design. 

An improvement that would require a bit of time would be to design a way for the renderer to easily handle shapes beyond rectangles. I found some ways to do this but it would require a good chunk of hours, but would make it more exciting to make a more detailed game.
